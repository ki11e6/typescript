### **What Are Linked Lists?**

A **linked list** is a linear data structure consisting of nodes where each node contains:
1. **Data**: The value or information the node holds.
2. **Pointer (Next)**: A reference or pointer to the next node in the sequence.

In contrast to arrays, linked lists do not store elements in contiguous memory locations. They rely on pointers to link elements, making them dynamic and flexible.

### **Types of Linked Lists**

1. **Singly Linked List**:
   - Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.
   - **Example**: A -> B -> C -> `null`

2. **Doubly Linked List**:
   - Each node contains data, a pointer to the next node, and a pointer to the previous node.
   - **Example**: `null` <- A <-> B <-> C -> `null`

3. **Circular Linked List**:
   - Similar to a singly or doubly linked list, but the last node points back to the head, forming a loop.
   - **Example (Singly)**: A -> B -> C -> A
   - **Example (Doubly)**: A <-> B <-> C <-> A

4. **Skip List**:
   - A linked list with additional pointers that allow "skipping" multiple nodes for faster traversal, often used in databases.

### **Common Linked List Manipulations**

| **Operation**   | **Description**                               | **Time Complexity**                 | **Space Complexity** |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Traversal**   | Visit each node sequentially.                 | O(n)                                | O(1)                 |
| **Search**      | Find a node with a specific value.            | O(n)                                | O(1)                 |
| **Insertion**   | Add a node at the head, tail, or middle.      | O(1) (head) / O(n) (tail or middle) | O(1)                 |
| **Deletion**    | Remove a node from the head, tail, or middle. | O(1) (head) / O(n) (tail or middle) | O(1)                 |
| **Reversal**    | Reverse the order of nodes in the list.       | O(n)                                | O(1)                 |
| **Merge**       | Merge two sorted linked lists into one.       | O(n + m)                            | O(1)                 |
| **Sort**        | Sort the linked list (e.g., merge sort).      | O(n log n)                          | O(1)                 |
| **Detect Loop** | Check if the linked list contains a cycle.    | O(n)                                | O(1)                 |
| **Find Middle** | Find the middle node of the linked list.      | O(n) or O(n/2)                      | O(1)                 |

### **Why Use Linked Lists?**

#### **Advantages**
1. **Dynamic Size**:
   - Unlike arrays, linked lists grow and shrink as needed without predefining their size.
2. **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**:
   - Adding or removing elements is more efficient than arrays, especially at the head or middle.
3. **Memory Utilization**:
   - Nodes are allocated only when needed, reducing wasted space.

#### **Disadvantages**
1. **Sequential Access**:
   - Traversal and search operations are slower than arrays (O(n) vs. O(1) for random access in arrays).
2. **Memory Overhead**:
   - Each node requires extra memory for the pointer(s).
3. **Cache Performance**:
   - Nodes are stored in scattered memory locations, reducing cache efficiency.

### **Where and Why to Use Linked Lists?**

#### **Where to Use**
- When frequent insertions/deletions are required.
- When memory needs to be dynamically allocated.
- For creating complex data structures like stacks, queues, and graphs.
- For undo functionality in text editors (using doubly linked lists).
- To manage memory fragmentation (e.g., in operating systems).

#### **Why Not to Use**
- When random access is needed (use arrays instead).
- When memory overhead is a concern due to pointer storage.
- When data is small and fits well in contiguous memory.

| **Insert (Position)**  | Insert a node at a specific position.               | To maintain sorted or custom orders.                |

### **Problems with Linked Lists**

1. **Memory Overhead**:
   - The additional storage required for pointers increases memory usage.
2. **Slow Traversal**:
   - Linear traversal is inefficient for large datasets.
3. **Difficult Debugging**:
   - Tracking pointer errors or loops in linked lists is challenging.
4. **Pointer Management**:
   - Errors in pointer assignment can lead to memory leaks or crashes.
