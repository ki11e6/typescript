### **Hashes in Data Structures**

**1. What is a Hash?**
A **hash** is a data structure that maps keys to values using a **hash function**. The hash function converts keys into a hash code (usually an integer) which determines the index in a storage array.

In JavaScript, hashes are implemented using **objects** and the **`Map`** data structure.

### **2. Types of Hashing Structures**

1. **Hash Table**:
   - Stores key-value pairs where the key is hashed to determine its index in the storage.
   - Collision resolution strategies:
     - **Chaining**: Use linked lists or other structures to handle collisions.
     - **Open Addressing**: Store collided keys in a different location using probing.

2. **Hash Set**:
   - Stores unique elements and uses hashes for quick lookups.
   - Does not associate keys with values.

3. **JavaScript Object (`{}`)**:
   - A default hash-like structure where keys are strings or symbols.
   - Values are accessed via keys.

4. **JavaScript `Map`**:
   - A specialized hash structure allowing any value type as a key (not just strings or symbols).
   - Preserves insertion order of keys.

| Search (Lookup) | O(1)                          | O(n) (with collisions)      | O(n)                 |
| Rehashing       | O(n)                          | O(n)                        | O(n)                 |

### **5. Why Use Hashes?**
- **Fast Operations**: O(1) average time complexity for insert, delete, and search.
- **Dynamic Size**: Automatically resizes to accommodate new elements.
- **Key-Value Mapping**: Ideal for associative arrays or dictionaries.
- **Flexibility**: JavaScript `Map` supports keys of any data type, making it more versatile than plain objects.

---

### **6. Where to Use Hashes?**
- **Data Caching**: Store frequently accessed data for fast retrieval.
- **Indexing**: Quickly locate data using unique keys.
- **Counting Frequencies**: Count occurrences of elements (e.g., word frequency in text).
- **Memoization**: Store results of expensive function calls.
- **Lookups**: Efficiently check membership in sets or dictionaries.

---

### **7. Why Not Use Hashes?**
- **Memory Overhead**: Hashes require more memory due to storage of hash codes, pointers, and potential collisions.
- **Order Dependency**: Hashes (e.g., `Map`) may not always preserve the exact order of keys (depending on implementation).
- **Inefficiency for Small Data**: For small data sets, a simple array or list may be faster and more memory-efficient.
- **Collision Issues**: Poor hash functions or high load factors can degrade performance to O(n).

---

### **8. Advantages of Hashes**
1. **Fast Operations**: O(1) average complexity for most operations.
2. **Flexibility**: Supports a wide variety of use cases.
3. **Dynamic Nature**: Automatically resizes to fit new data.
4. **Versatile Keys**: `Map` supports any value type as a key.

---

### **9. Disadvantages of Hashes**
1. **High Memory Usage**: Requires extra space for hash codes and collision resolution.
2. **Non-Sequential Access**: Not ideal for scenarios requiring ordered data.
3. **Collision Handling**: Poor hash functions can degrade performance significantly.
4. **Iteration Overhead**: Iterating through hashes is slower than through arrays.

---

### **10. Common Problems with Hashes**
1. **Hash Collisions**:
   - Multiple keys mapping to the same index, leading to slower performance.
   - Solution: Use a good hash function or reduce the load factor by resizing.

2. **Iteration Order**:
   - Object keys in JavaScript are unordered; `Map` preserves insertion order but may not always behave as expected.
   - Solution: Use arrays or other ordered structures if strict order is necessary.

3. **Memory Overhead**:
   - Hashes use more memory compared to arrays.
   - Solution: Optimize load factor or switch to compact structures for large datasets.

4. **Debugging Challenges**:
   - Debugging collisions or rehashing issues can be tricky.
   - Solution: Use logging or visualization tools to monitor hash behavior.

### **Diving Deeper into Hash Implementation and Collision Handling**

#### **1. Hash Implementation**
A hash is implemented using a combination of a **hash function** and an underlying data structure (usually an array or linked list). Here's how it works:

1. **Hash Function**:
   - A **hash function** converts a key into an integer (hash code).
   - Example: `hash(key) = key % size`, where `size` is the length of the storage array.
   - A good hash function ensures **uniform distribution** of hash codes and minimizes collisions.

2. **Storage Array**:
   - The hash code is used to determine the **index** in the storage array where the value is stored.
   - In JavaScript, the **`Map`** data structure or plain objects (`{}`) are used as hash maps.

3. **Collision Resolution**:
   - If multiple keys hash to the same index, a **collision** occurs.
   - Collision resolution techniques are used to ensure proper storage and retrieval of data.

---

#### **2. Collision Handling Techniques**
Collisions are inevitable in hash implementations due to the limited size of the storage array. Several strategies are used to handle them:

---

### **Chaining**
- **Approach**:
  - Each index of the storage array points to a linked list (or another structure) of key-value pairs.
  - If multiple keys hash to the same index, they are stored in the linked list.
- **Advantages**:
  - Simple to implement.
  - No limit on the number of keys hashed to the same index.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Performance degrades as the linked list grows.
  - Increased memory usage due to pointers in the linked list.

```javascript
class HashTable {
  constructor(size) {
    this.buckets = new Array(size).fill(null).map(() => []);
  }

  hash(key) {
    return key.toString().length % this.buckets.length;
  }

  set(key, value) {
    const index = this.hash(key);
    const bucket = this.buckets[index];
    for (let pair of bucket) {
      if (pair[0] === key) {
        pair[1] = value; // Update existing key
        return;
      }
    }
    bucket.push([key, value]); // Add new key-value pair
  }

  get(key) {
    const index = this.hash(key);
    const bucket = this.buckets[index];
    for (let pair of bucket) {
      if (pair[0] === key) {
        return pair[1];
      }
    }
    return undefined; // Key not found
  }
}

const hashTable = new HashTable(10);
hashTable.set('apple', 5);
hashTable.set('banana', 10);
console.log(hashTable.get('apple')); // Output: 5
```

---

### **Open Addressing**
- **Approach**:
  - Instead of using linked lists, the storage array itself is used to resolve collisions by finding another empty slot.
  - Common techniques:
    1. **Linear Probing**:
       - Check the next slot sequentially until an empty slot is found.
       - Example: `index = (hash(key) + i) % size`.
    2. **Quadratic Probing**:
       - Use quadratic increments to reduce clustering:
         - Example: `index = (hash(key) + i^2) % size`.
    3. **Double Hashing**:
       - Use a second hash function to determine the step size for probing.

- **Advantages**:
  - Avoids memory overhead of linked lists.
  - Typically faster for small loads.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Performance degrades as the table fills up.
  - Rehashing is required when the load factor becomes too high.

```javascript
class OpenAddressingHashTable {
  constructor(size) {
    this.buckets = new Array(size).fill(null);
    this.size = size;
  }

  hash(key, attempt = 0) {
    const hash1 = key.toString().length % this.size;
    const hash2 = 1 + (key.toString().length % (this.size - 1));
    return (hash1 + attempt * hash2) % this.size; // Double hashing
  }

  set(key, value) {
    let attempt = 0;
    let index = this.hash(key, attempt);
    while (this.buckets[index] && this.buckets[index][0] !== key) {
      attempt++;
      index = this.hash(key, attempt);
    }
    this.buckets[index] = [key, value];
  }

  get(key) {
    let attempt = 0;
    let index = this.hash(key, attempt);
    while (this.buckets[index]) {
      if (this.buckets[index][0] === key) {
        return this.buckets[index][1];
      }
      attempt++;
      index = this.hash(key, attempt);
    }
    return undefined;
  }
}

const oaHashTable = new OpenAddressingHashTable(10);
oaHashTable.set('apple', 5);
oaHashTable.set('banana', 10);
console.log(oaHashTable.get('apple')); // Output: 5
```

### **Rehashing**
- **What**: When the load factor (number of elements/array size) exceeds a threshold, the hash table is resized.
- **How**:
  1. Allocate a new storage array with a larger size (typically double the original).
  2. Recompute the hash for each key and place it in the new array.
- **Advantages**:
  - Maintains performance by reducing collisions.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Expensive operation (O(n)) when resizing.

---

### **3. Factors Affecting Performance**
1. **Load Factor**:
   - The ratio of elements to array size.
   - Lower load factors reduce collisions but increase memory usage.
   - Typical thresholds for rehashing: 0.6–0.8.

2. **Hash Function Quality**:
   - Poor hash functions lead to clustering or collisions.
   - A good hash function distributes keys uniformly.

---

### **4. Practical Considerations**
- **When to Use Chaining**:
  - When memory is not a concern, or there are frequent insertions/deletions.
- **When to Use Open Addressing**:
  - When memory usage must be minimized, or the table size is predictable.

| **Technique**         | **Advantages**                               | **Disadvantages**                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Chaining**          | Simple to implement, unlimited entries.      | Extra memory usage, degraded performance.      |
| **Linear Probing**    | Simple implementation, efficient memory use. | Clustering causes degraded performance.        |
| **Quadratic Probing** | Reduces clustering.                          | Secondary clustering still possible.           |
| **Double Hashing**    | Minimizes clustering further.                | Requires two hash functions, more computation. |
